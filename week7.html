                Description of the website design process from a game designer's perspective with regards to Gamification and its prevalence in modern society and human day-to-day living:

                I. Defining the Design Goals
                A. Understanding the game's brand and target audience: The website design should align with the game's brand and appeal to its target audience.
                B. Defining the website's purpose: The website's purpose should be clear and aligned with the game's goals, such as promoting the game, providing information, or selling merchandise.
                
                II. Incorporating Gamification
                A. Identifying game mechanics: Identify game mechanics, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, that can be incorporated into the website to make it more engaging and rewarding for users.
                B. Determining game goals: Determine the goals and objectives of the game, including what actions users should take to earn points and rewards.
                C. Implementing game elements: Implement the game elements into the website design and user interface, such as integrating points and rewards into user profiles or creating a leaderboard to track user progress.
                
                III. Functionality and Production
                A. Developing website functionality: Develop website functionality, such as forms, buttons, and interactive elements, to provide a seamless user experience.
                B. Producing visual assets: Produce visual assets, such as images and videos, to enhance the website's design and appeal to the target audience.
                C. Testing and refining: Test the website for functionality and usability, and refine the design based on user feedback and testing results.
                D. Launching and maintaining: Launch the website and maintain it over time, including updating content, fixing bugs, and adding new features.
